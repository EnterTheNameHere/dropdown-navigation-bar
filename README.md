I'm closing this repository. It's proof of concept, a way how it can be done, but now it doesn't only catches dust, it catches more and more security alerts too. I leave this only for archiving purpose.

**Update dependencies if you want to use the package**
======================================================

How to use the package? Clone repository, link it with Atom's package manager (remember to use [babel parser provider](https://github.com/EnterTheNameHere/dropdown-navigation-bar-babel-provider) too) and activate.
